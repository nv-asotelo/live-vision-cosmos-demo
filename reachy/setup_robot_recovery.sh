#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Let this Orin restart the Reachy Mini's daemon, and nothing else, when the daemon wedges.
#
# Run ON THE ORIN, once per robot (and again after the robot's OS is reinstalled), as the account
# the bridge runs as (User= in reachy-mjpeg-bridge.service) - not root: the key and the robot's
# known_hosts entry must be that account's. Needs sshpass (sudo apt install sshpass).
#
#   bash /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/reachy/setup_robot_recovery.sh [pollen@<robot-address>] [orin-address-the-robot-sees]
#
# The robot defaults to pollen@ the address this Orin is configured for (REACHY_MINI_IP, kept in
# /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/reachy.env by setup-orin.sh and scripts/set-reachy-ip.sh). After
# switching robots, run it again for the new one: the key is installed per robot.
#
# Installing the key does nothing by itself: the bridge only uses it when started with
# --recover-ssh and --recover-key, which the shipped unit doesn't pass. This script prints the
# systemd drop-in that turns it on when it finishes (a drop-in, because setup-orin.sh rewrites
# the main unit). Until that's in place a wedged daemon still needs a power-cycle.
#
# Why this exists. Daemon 1.11 leaks sockets on every WebRTC session (TURN refreshes libnice never
# closes) and runs under the default soft limit of 1024 descriptors. Once it reaches the limit
# ("Too many open files") every new viewer fails, each failed setup stops the robot's camera
# pipeline, and neither the daemon's restart API nor a media release helps: both run inside the
# same process. Measured 2026-09-24: 1014 of 1024 descriptors in use, 778 of them sockets. Only a
# new process recovers, and a person was needed to power-cycle the robot.
#
# What it changes:
#   Orin   ~/.ssh/reachy_recover_ed25519 (created if missing, in the account running this
#          script), the robot's host key in known_hosts.
#   Robot  one line in ~pollen/.ssh/authorized_keys for that key: `restrict` (no pty, forwarding,
#          agent, X11 or user rc), `from=` the Orin's address only, and a forced command - whatever
#          the client asks for, the key runs `sudo -n systemctl restart --no-block
#          reachy-mini-daemon` and nothing else. --no-block returns once systemd has queued it; the
#          bridge then watches for the new daemon pid. pollen has passwordless sudo on the stock
#          image. Re-running replaces this line (matched by its comment), so it also repairs it.
#          /etc/systemd/system/reachy-mini-daemon.service.d/live-vision-cosmos-demo-nofile.conf
#          raising the daemon's descriptor limit to 16384, so the leak takes 16x longer to wedge
#          it. Takes effect at the daemon's next restart.
#
# It prompts for pollen's password once (the stock image uses "root") and never stores it.
#
# After reinstalling the robot's OS its host key changes, and both this script (accept-new) and the
# bridge (StrictHostKeyChecking=yes) will refuse it - as they should. Read the new fingerprint at
# the robot itself (`ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`), then on the Orin run
# `ssh-keygen -R <robot-address>`, re-run this script and compare the fingerprint it shows first.
