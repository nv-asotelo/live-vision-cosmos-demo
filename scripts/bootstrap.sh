# Laptop-side bootstrap: copies this repo to a Jetson Orin over SSH and runs the Orin-side
# build (scripts/setup-orin.sh) there. By default this runs entirely on the laptop's CPU -
# no GPU, no particular OS, and no local Python/CUDA/build toolchain are needed. Everything
# that needs a GPU or a big download happens on the Orin itself, over SSH.
#
# Optional --host-quantize uses the LAPTOP's own CPU and RAM to do the LLM text-tower
# quantize+export step instead of the Orin - see "Host-accelerated quantization" below and
# in README.md. This is the only part of the pipeline that benefits from running off-device:
# it's RAM-bound (an 8 GB Orin Nano gets OOM-killed exporting with the SDK's primary
# V2/cuteDSL plugin), not GPU-bound. The model is quantized and exported on CPU either way -
# a GPU on the host is not required and is not used for this step; any machine with enough
# free RAM gets the better result.
#
# Requires only: bash, ssh, scp, tar (all present by default on macOS, Linux, and Windows
# via WSL or Git Bash/OpenSSH). --host-quantize additionally requires python3, git, rsync,
# and a Linux host with enough free RAM - see its own preflight checks below for exactly why.
#
# Usage:
#   export REACHY_MINI_IP=192.0.2.50        # optional - omit if you have no Reachy Mini
#   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh jetson@192.0.2.100
#   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh --host-quantize jetson@192.0.2.100     # better engine, Linux host only
#
# The Orin needs JetPack already flashed and booting, SSH reachable, and an account with
# sudo - you'll be asked for its password twice (copying the repo, then setup itself); an
# unattended run needs passwordless sudo instead. Everything else - cloning
# TensorRT-Edge-LLM, downloading and quantizing the checkpoint, building the engine,
# installing Piper/systemd - happens on the Orin itself, unless --host-quantize moved the
# quantize+export step here.

# Must match EDGELLM_COMMIT / COSMOS_MODEL_REPO / COSMOS_MODEL_REVISION in setup-orin.sh

# with what do_export_onnx_llm would have produced on-device.

Usage: ./scripts/bootstrap.sh [--host-quantize] user@orin-host-or-ip

JetPack 7.2.1 / L4T 39.2.1 must already boot on the Orin. Keep an existing
compatible installation. For a fresh SD card from a Mac, first follow
docs/jetpack-sd-mac.md or run scripts/flash-jetpack-sd-mac.sh --help.

Optional env vars:
  HF_TOKEN          Not needed: nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge is public and not gated on Hugging
                    Face. If you set one anyway, the download uses it.
  REACHY_MINI_IP    IP or hostname of a Reachy Mini robot on the same LAN. Omit for
                    camera+captioning only, with no robot-control panels. Change it (or add a
                    robot) later on the Orin with scripts/set-reachy-ip.sh - no re-run needed.
  SETUP_ORIN_USER   Account setup-orin.sh should own the install and run services as.
                    Default: whichever account you SSH in as.

Optional flag:
  --host-quantize   Do the LLM quantize+export step on THIS machine instead of the Orin,
                    using the SDK's primary V2/cuteDSL plugin instead of its legacy V1
                    fallback. Requires Linux (not macOS - NVIDIA's cuda-python has no macOS
                    wheel, any RAM amount) with at least 12 GB available RAM (the export
                    peaks near 9 GB). No GPU needed on this machine - the step is RAM-bound, not
                    GPU-bound. Without this flag, or on a host that doesn't qualify, the
                    Orin does this step itself and the result is fully functional but uses
                    the legacy plugin - see README.md "Host-accelerated quantization".

# and export_onnx_llm stages done, and clears the stages built on top of the old export, so
# the engine is rebuilt from it. That works the same on a fresh Orin and on one already set up
# (an upgrade from the V1 build), needs no extra sudo over SSH, and a copy that never finished
# is never adopted. The visual tower always still exports on the Orin; it was never the stage
# that OOMs.
#
# Why this check order (OS, then RAM): OS is a hard, unconditional disqualifier regardless
# of RAM - NVIDIA's cuda-bindings package (a base, non-optional dependency of
# tensorrt-edgellm itself) publishes manylinux and Windows wheels only, no macOS build at
# any Python version. A Mac with 128 GB of RAM still cannot install it. RAM is the real gate

NVIDIA's cuda-bindings package (a base dependency of tensorrt-edgellm, pulled in even just
to export a checkpoint) ships manylinux and Windows wheels only - there is no macOS build
at any Python version, for any Mac, regardless of how much RAM it has. This is a hard
platform limit, not a resource one: a MacBook Air and a maxed-out Mac Studio are equally
unable to run this step.

Omit --host-quantize to use the standard on-Orin path - it is fully functional, just uses
the SDK's legacy V1 INT4 GEMM plugin instead of its primary V2/cuteDSL one. See README.md
"Host-accelerated quantization" for what that tradeoff actually is. If you have a Linux
machine available (a desktop, a cloud VM, WSL on Windows), re-run bootstrap.sh with
--host-quantize from there instead.
