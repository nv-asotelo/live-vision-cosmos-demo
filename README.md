# Live Vision + Reachy Mini + Cosmos3-Edge

**Upgrade candidate: TensorRT-Edge-LLM 0.11.0.** This branch requires freshly exported
and rebuilt engines. Offline migration checks pass; Orin execution, quality, RAM and
latency still need validation. Measurements elsewhere in this README describe the
0.10.1 baseline, not results for this candidate. See the
[upgrade recommendation and validation plan](docs/edgellm-0.11-upgrade.md).

A minimal, low-RAM camera/VLM web UI that runs a locally-hosted **NVIDIA Cosmos3-Edge** model on a
Jetson Orin over TensorRT-Edge-LLM, with live **Reachy Mini** robot control (motors, onboard apps,
pose, text-to-speech) alongside it. No cloud calls, no framework - the web server
(`ui/scripts/serve_ui.py` + `engine_backends.py`) is standard-library Python; only robot control
(`reachy/reachy.py`) also needs `requests`, which `setup-orin.sh` installs as `python3-requests`.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ui/` | Live Vision: `scripts/serve_ui.py` + `scripts/engine_backends.py` (stdlib-only `http.server`, no framework; robot control imports `reachy/reachy.py`, which needs `requests`) + `web/`. Camera/VLM UI, Reachy motor/app/TTS control, engine switching with a live progress bar. |
| `reachy/reachy.py` | Thin REST client for the Reachy Mini daemon (motors, pose, apps, volume, sound upload/play). Only third-party dependency: `requests`. |
| `reachy/reachy_mjpeg_bridge.py` | WebRTC-to-HTTP bridge for the robot's camera/mic (needed only for "switch to Reachy Mini" as a *video* source - motor/app/TTS control works without it). |
| `shim/cosmos3_shim_v1.py` | The Cosmos3-Edge TensorRT-Edge-LLM serving shim - an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint in front of the built engine. |
| `systemd/` | Unit templates for the three services (UI, shim, Reachy bridge) and two drop-ins for running a multi-GB resident model on an 8 GB board without swap thrashing. |
| `ui/tests/`, run via `python3 -m unittest discover -s ui/tests` and `node --test ui/tests/test_engine_switch.js` | 50 tests, no device or GPU required - a fake HTTP backend and a fake DOM stand in for both. |
| `scripts/bootstrap.sh` | Run **from a laptop** (any OS, no GPU required; by default it does no compute itself). Copies this repo to the Orin over SSH and runs `setup-orin.sh` there. Optional `--host-quantize` (Linux host, 12 GB+ available RAM) does the LLM quantize+export step locally instead, for the SDK's primary V2/cuteDSL plugin instead of its legacy fallback - see "Host-accelerated quantization". |
| `scripts/set-reachy-ip.sh` | Run **on the Orin** to point the demo at a (different) Reachy Mini by IP or hostname. Checks the robot answers, rewrites `reachy.env`, restarts the two Reachy-facing services (the first time on an Orin set up without a robot, it re-runs setup's Reachy stages instead, restarting inference too) - see "Switching robots later". |
| `scripts/setup-orin.sh` | Run **on the Orin** (`bootstrap.sh` does this for you; by hand, from `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo`: `export REACHY_MINI_IP=...` if you have a robot, then `sudo -E bash scripts/setup-orin.sh` - no Hugging Face token needed). Idempotent, one-shot: builds TensorRT-Edge-LLM, downloads the Cosmos3-Edge checkpoint, quantizes it to INT4 with the vendored RTN pre-quantization pass, exports and builds the engine, installs Piper/TLS/systemd, starts the services. |
| `scripts/flash-jetpack-sd-mac.sh` | Optional Mac one-shot for a clean JetPack 7.2.1 SD card; helpers in `scripts/jetpack/`, agent skill in `.agents/skills/flash-jetpack-sd-mac/`. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Setup/deployment recipe written for an AI coding agent to follow unattended, plus the "don't change these without re-deriving them" list for the pinned build constants below, and why checking generated text (not just health endpoints) matters. `CLAUDE.md` points here. |

## Quickstart: automated setup

**Already running JetPack 7.2.1 / Jetson Linux 39.2.1? Keep it.** A fresh JetPack
installation is not needed; setup installs any missing pinned CUDA/TensorRT components.

**Need a fresh SD card first?** On an Apple Silicon MacBook with macOS 15+, 16 GB RAM,
60 GiB free disk, Apple Command Line Tools, Homebrew, internet, an SD reader, and
administrator/disk-access permission, run in Terminal:

```bash
brew install python qemu zstd
diskutil list                       # identify the 64 GB+ SD card
./scripts/flash-jetpack-sd-mac.sh --disk /dev/diskN --erase
```

This optional route targets the **Orin Nano Super 8 GB developer kit (P3767-0005)**
with compatible R39.2.1 QSPI firmware already installed. It prepares OS and NVIDIA drivers
only. Boot the card, complete first-boot setup, enable SSH, then continue below.
Validated on a **fresh 64 GB SD card** using this script and
[agent skill](.agents/skills/flash-jetpack-sd-mac/SKILL.md): writing and full image
readback passed on 2026-09-29; SD boot is not yet tested.
See the [Mac workflow and validation record](docs/jetpack-sd-mac.md) for scope.

Starting point: a Jetson Orin with **JetPack already flashed and booting**, reachable over
SSH, and nothing else installed - plus any laptop (any OS, no GPU required; by default the
laptop does no compute, it just drives the Orin over SSH). End point: a working
`https://<orin-ip>:8443/` serving live camera captions from a locally-built TensorRT engine.

```bash
export REACHY_MINI_IP=192.0.2.50        # optional - omit if you have no Reachy Mini
./scripts/bootstrap.sh jetson-user@orin-ip
```

That's the whole setup - no Hugging Face token needed.
It clones and builds TensorRT-Edge-LLM, downloads and quantizes the
Cosmos3-Edge checkpoint, exports and builds the engine, installs Piper/TLS/systemd, and
starts everything - entirely on the Orin, over SSH from whatever laptop you ran it from. It
takes well over an hour on an Orin Nano, dominated by the on-device TensorRT-Edge-LLM native
build; it's idempotent, so if it fails partway (a flaky download, a transient apt mirror),
fix the reported problem and re-run it - completed stages are not repeated. Each completed
stage leaves a root-owned marker in `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/.setup-state/`; `sudo rm`
one to make the next run redo that stage.

`bootstrap.sh` copies this repo to `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo` on the Orin - always that
path, which `setup-orin.sh`, the systemd units and the shim hardcode - then runs
`setup-orin.sh` there as root over `ssh -t`. From a git checkout it copies the last commit
(`git archive HEAD`), not uncommitted edits. The Orin account's sudo password is asked for
twice: once to create and `chown` that directory, then for `setup-orin.sh` itself. Each step
is its own SSH connection, so with password login the SSH password is asked for at every one:
an unattended run needs passwordless sudo on the Orin and SSH key login to it.

**Switching robots later** (a spare Reachy Mini, a new DHCP lease, or adding one to an Orin set
up without) takes one command on the Orin, not a re-run of `bootstrap.sh`. An Orin set up by
an earlier version of this repo, before that command existed (read the note on stage markers
below before running it there), has no copy of it: refresh the repo there first, from the root
of a laptop checkout of this repo:

```bash
git archive --format=tar HEAD | ssh jetson-user@orin-ip "tar -x -C /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo"
```

The command itself, on the Orin - through `bash`, so the file's execute bit doesn't matter:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/scripts/set-reachy-ip.sh 192.0.2.77     # or reachy-mini.local
```

The address lives in one place: `REACHY_MINI_IP` in `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/reachy.env`,
which the UI and camera/mic bridge services read when they start. The script first checks that
a Reachy Mini daemon answers at `http://<address>:8000/api/daemon/status` and changes nothing if
none does (`--force` sets it anyway, for a robot that's off right now), then rewrites
`reachy.env` and restarts the UI and camera/mic bridge - seconds, with inference running
throughout. The exception is the first change on an Orin set up without a robot, or with units
from an older version of this repo that wrote the address into `ExecStart`: there it writes
`reachy.env` and re-runs `setup-orin.sh`'s Reachy stages once (`setup_reachy_env` - a pip
install, so it needs internet - then `install_systemd_units` and `enable_services`), which also
restarts the inference shim: about a minute while the model reloads. Every change after that
takes the fast path. With no argument it prints the current address.

That slow path works by re-running `setup-orin.sh`, so it also runs any other stage that has no
marker in `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/.setup-state/` - on an Orin set up by an older version
of this repo, the stages added since. Compare that directory with the `stage` lines in `main()`
of `scripts/setup-orin.sh` before running it there. `pin_clocks` is harmless to run; the ONNX
exports are not - with the shim loaded, re-exporting the model on the device is slow and
memory-hungry. An `export_onnx` marker (from versions that exported both towers in one stage)
means that stage's output is already on disk, so mark the two stages that replaced it done
first:

```bash
sudo touch /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/.setup-state/export_onnx_llm /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/.setup-state/export_onnx_visual
```

**Robot-daemon recovery** is opt-in. When the robot's daemon wedges, the bridge can restart it
over SSH instead of someone power-cycling the robot. To set that up, run this on the Orin as
the bridge's service account (not root; it needs `sshpass`):

```bash
bash /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/reachy/setup_robot_recovery.sh   # [pollen@<robot-address>] [orin-address-the-robot-sees]
```

With no arguments it logs in to the robot in `reachy.env` as `pollen` and works out which Orin
address the robot sees. It installs a restricted key on the robot that can only restart the
daemon, then prints the systemd drop-in
(`/etc/systemd/system/reachy-mjpeg-bridge.service.d/10-recover.conf`) that turns recovery on in
the bridge. The key is per robot: after switching robots, run it again for the new one.

**Hugging Face access:** no token is needed. `nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge` is public and not gated,
so setup downloads it without one (if `HF_TOKEN` is set anyway, the download uses it). If
Hugging Face ever refuses the download because the model has been gated since, setup stops with
a message saying what to do.

If you're an AI coding agent doing this setup for someone, read `AGENTS.md` first - it
covers the one thing setup can need from a person (passwords), and which build parameters are
pinned to a measured working configuration rather than being arbitrary defaults.

The rest of this README (below) is the manual, step-by-step reference the automation is
built from - useful for understanding what a stage actually does, debugging a failure, or
adapting the pipeline to a different checkpoint revision.

### Host-accelerated quantization (optional, `--host-quantize`)

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh --host-quantize jetson-user@orin-ip
```

By default, the Orin itself quantizes the text tower and exports it with the TensorRT-Edge-LLM
SDK's **legacy V1 INT4 GEMM plugin** (`Int4GroupwiseGemmPlugin`, AWQ-swizzled weights) rather
than its **primary V2 plugin** (`Int4GroupwiseGemmPluginV2`, cuteDSL fragment-layout weights,
the SDK's own default when no `--int4-gemm-plugin-version` is given at all). This isn't a
deliberate quality choice - it's a fallback forced by a confirmed, reproducible constraint:
exporting with V2 **on an 8 GB Orin Nano gets killed by the kernel's OOM killer partway through
the export itself**, not at engine-build time. Measured on an idle Orin - every demo service
stopped, as during a real fresh setup - the export reached **6.8 GB** resident before the
kernel killed it, with system-wide available memory down to 40 MB. Run to completion on a
larger machine, the same export peaks at **8.96 GB** - more than an 8 GB board has in total.
(An earlier figure of 3.7 GB, quoted in previous versions of this README, was measured with the
inference service still holding ~3.5 GB; the conclusion held, the number didn't.)

V1's export has a lower peak memory footprint and fits; V2's cannot, on this board, however
idle. **This is a RAM ceiling on the machine doing the export, not a GPU requirement and not
a limit on INT4 accuracy** - the quantization algorithm, its weights, and the GEMM math both
plugins compute are the same either way. (Checked: on-Orin and host quantization of the same
checkpoint produce byte-identical exported weights.)

`--host-quantize` does the quantize+export step on **your laptop/workstation instead** - so
it's the SDK's primary V2 path, not its legacy fallback, with no change to accuracy. It runs
entirely on CPU; a GPU on the host is not required and is not used for this step. The export
is copied to a staging directory on the Orin
(`/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning/llm.host`), flagged
complete only once the copy has finished, and `setup-orin.sh` adopts it (`adopt_host_export`):
it swaps the export in, marks its own `quantize` and `export_onnx_llm` stages done, and clears
the stages built on the old export (`fix_chat_template`, `build_engine`, `enable_services`,
`smoke_test`), so the engine is rebuilt from it. A copy that never finished is discarded, not
adopted. The vision tower is still exported on the Orin; it isn't the step that runs out of
memory. So `--host-quantize` works on a fresh Orin and also upgrades one already set up with
the default V1 path: re-run `bootstrap.sh` with `--host-quantize`, and completed stages such as
the SDK build and the checkpoint download are skipped.

**Requirements**, all hard gates:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **Linux** (not macOS, at any RAM size) | NVIDIA's `cuda-bindings` package - a *base* dependency of `tensorrt-edgellm`, pulled in even just to export a checkpoint - ships `manylinux` and Windows wheels only. There is no macOS build at any Python version. A MacBook Pro or a Mac Studio with 128 GB of RAM cannot run this step; it is excluded on OS grounds, not resources. Windows users: use WSL. |
| **≥ 12 GB available RAM** (`MemAvailable`; `HOST_QUANTIZE_MIN_RAM_GB` in `bootstrap.sh`) | The V2 export's measured peak is 8.96 GB (x86 Linux host, run to completion); 12 GB leaves about 3 GB of headroom for variance between hosts and whatever else is running. **Light-RAM laptops can't clear this bar** - an 8 GB-class machine (the tier some MacBook Air configurations ship with, were macOS not already excluded above) never will, and a 16 GB machine only with most of its memory free (close the browser first). Either way it falls back to the standard path automatically. |
| **`python3`, `git` and `rsync`** on the host | `git` clones TensorRT-Edge-LLM at the pinned commit, `python3` gets a local venv with its `export` extra for the quantize and export, and `rsync` copies the export to the Orin. |

If any check fails, `bootstrap.sh` prints which one, then **falls back to the standard on-Orin
path automatically** - it does not abort the whole setup. A failure later in the host-side step
falls back the same way, and a missing `nvidia-smi` on the host is only a warning. The resulting
engine is fully functional either way; only the plugin differs.

If you're an AI agent running this setup unattended on behalf of someone with only a
light-RAM or macOS laptop available, do not try to work around these checks (e.g. by lying
about free RAM, or attempting the export on an unsupported OS) - they're hard platform/
resource limits, not conservative guesses. Tell the user plainly that they got the on-Orin
legacy-plugin build, why, and that it's fully functional.

## Requirements

- **Jetson Orin (Nano or better) booting JetPack 7.2.1 / L4T 39.2.1.** Keep an existing
  compatible installation, or use the optional [Mac SD workflow](docs/jetpack-sd-mac.md)
  for the supported Orin Nano Super developer kit before application setup.
- **A 64 GB SD card or larger is recommended.** The application layer itself (this repo, the built
  engine, Piper, and the TensorRT-Edge-LLM Python environment the shim runs in) is roughly 5 GB;
  the complete build also needs CUDA/TensorRT development packages and intermediate model
  files. Use at least 64 GB for this workflow; the setup script checks available build space.
- **NVIDIA's [TensorRT-Edge-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM) SDK**, built on
  device, to both build the Cosmos3-Edge engine and provide the Python venv the shim runs from.
  Not vendored in this repo - it's a substantial NVIDIA SDK with its own license and update cycle.
- Reachy Mini robot on the same LAN, if you want the robot-control features. Everything else
  (webcam + Cosmos3-Edge captioning) works without one.

## Setup

The [Quickstart](#quickstart-automated-setup) above automates everything in this section via
`scripts/setup-orin.sh`. What follows is the manual, step-by-step version of the same
recipe - read it to understand what a build stage actually does, to debug a failure, or to
adapt the pipeline to a different checkpoint revision. It is not a second way to set this up;
it's what the automation runs, spelled out.

### 1. Build TensorRT-Edge-LLM and the Cosmos3-Edge engine

Everything in this step lives inside this repo's checkout at `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo`, so
make that first - the `mkdir`/`chown` and `git clone` lines of step 2 - and run the commands
below from there. Clone [NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Edge-LLM)
at commit `95515c2f87fba8982db5a519f9022277667b3cc9` (tag `v0.11.0`), with its submodules, into
`/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM`, give it a Python venv at `.venv`
inside that directory, and build its native runtime per its own instructions
(`kernelSrcs/build_cutedsl.py` for the `fmha` and `int4_fp16_gemm` kernel groups, then a CMake
configure/build for the `_edgellm_runtime`, `NvInfer_edgellm_plugin`, `llm_build`, and
`visual_build` targets), then pip-install the SDK itself into that venv, editable, with its
`server,server-tools,export,tools` extras: that install is what provides the
`.venv/bin/tensorrt-edgellm-export` the export steps below call, and the FastAPI and uvicorn the
shim imports. The build needs the pinned CUDA 13.2 / TensorRT 10.16 packages first -
`sudo bash scripts/install-jetpack-compute.sh` (the `jetpack_compute` stage) - plus the apt
packages in `do_system_packages`. See `scripts/setup-orin.sh`'s `do_fetch_edgellm`,
`do_edgellm_venv` and `do_build_edgellm_runtime` for the exact commands and environment this
repo builds against. The shim unit's `ExecStart` (the venv's python) and the shim's
`EDGELLM_ROOT` default (where it finds the SDK's `build/` outputs) both expect that location;
with the SDK anywhere else, edit `ExecStart` and set `EDGELLM_ROOT` for the shim - and
`SHARED_CHECKPOINT_DIR`, whose default is relative to it. Then:

1. **Download `nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge` at revision `344d602b128d1bbdacb43b08d0a3626f46343e29`**
   from Hugging Face into `checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/raw` (see NOTICE.md - the model is under the
   [OpenMDW License 1.1](https://openmdw.ai/license/1-1/); it isn't gated, so no Hugging Face
   token is needed). Pin that revision - the quantizer below refuses a receipt (step 2)
   for any other. The reasoner's LLM weights are indexed directly at the snapshot root by
   `model.safetensors.index.json` (698 tensors); the vision tower is a separate
   `vision_encoder/` subfolder. Neither needs the sibling `vae/` (image/video generation
   decoder) or other omni components this demo never loads - `scripts/setup-orin.sh`'s
   `do_download_checkpoint` reads the root index first to fetch exactly the shards it
   references, plus `vision_encoder/*` and the root-level files in its `allow` list (tokenizer,
   chat template, generation, preprocessor and processor configs, and the `README.md` model
   card).
2. **Check the four multimodal token IDs in the downloaded checkpoint's `config.json`**
   before export - `image_token_id`, `video_token_id`, `vision_start_token_id`,
   `vision_end_token_id`. The exporter needs them and does not derive them on its own. The
   pinned revision's `config.json` already carries them, with the values this repo's deployed
   engine uses (`19`, `18`, `20`, `21` respectively); `do_fix_raw_config` adds any that are
   missing. **Then write the download receipt the quantizer requires**,
   `results/model-download.json` in the repo root, as `do_fix_raw_config` does right after
   that check: `"revision": "344d602b128d1bbdacb43b08d0a3626f46343e29"`,
   `"complete": true`, and under `"files"` a `sha256` for every top-level `.json`, `.jinja` and
   `.md` file of the checkpoint plus both `size_bytes` and `sha256` for every weight shard.
   Write it last: the quantizer checks `config.json` against it, and copies only the metadata
   files it lists into the quantized checkpoint.
3. **Quantize to INT4 with `vendor/quantize_cosmos3_rtn.py`** (CPU-only, symmetric
   round-to-nearest, group-128; not part of NVIDIA's TensorRT-Edge-LLM SDK - see NOTICE.md
   for where this script comes from). It isn't executable: run it with the SDK venv's python
   (as `do_quantize` does), here from the repo root:

   ```
   external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/.venv/bin/python vendor/quantize_cosmos3_rtn.py \
     --source checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/raw --output checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/quantized \
     --quantization-scope all-linears --apply
   ```

   `--output` must be inside this repo and must not exist yet - the script never overwrites
   one, so delete it to redo the step. It accepts only a receipt whose `revision` is the pinned
   one and whose `complete` is true, but it never reads the downloaded snapshot's own revision,
   so that check is only as good as the pin in step 1. It then checks the source's
   `config.json`, index, shard sizes and SHA-256 hashes (and those of the metadata files it
   copies) against the receipt, and stops at the first mismatch.

   The exporter's own on-the-fly `--quantization` flag
   does **not** work for this checkpoint - it's gated on Mixture-of-Experts detection in
   `tensorrt_edgellm/scripts/export.py`, and Cosmos3-Edge's reasoner is a *dense* model
   (`config.json`: `backbone_type: "cosmos3_edge_nemotron_dense"`); the flag silently exports
   plain FP16 with no warning at all, which runs and serves correctly but at ~4x the memory
   and meaningfully slower than real INT4. A real pre-quantization pass is required.
   **The quantizer's own output metadata matters as much as its math.** It must embed
   `"quantization_config": {"quant_method": "gptq", "group_size": 128}` **directly in
   `config.json`** - that exact key (`quant_method`, not `quant_algo`) in that exact location
   is the *only* code path `tensorrt_edgellm/config.py`'s `_algo_to_quant_type()` recognizes
   as GPTQ-packed; it has no "GPTQ" branch for any `quant_algo` string at all. A sidecar
   `hf_quant_config.json` file (a very natural thing to write, and what earlier versions of
   this quantizer did) is checked for *existence* first and unconditionally short-circuits
   detection before the parser would ever reach the correct path - so even a well-formed
   sidecar file silently routes the checkpoint to `QUANT_FP16`, and the packed INT4 tensors
   underneath get loaded as if they were raw FP16 weight bytes. That produces a checkpoint
   which builds and serves without any error, with structurally valid API responses and
   correct token counts, but generates complete garbage text - repeated nonsense characters -
   on every request, regardless of prompt. Confirmed by isolation testing on real hardware:
   the packed weight values and zero-point convention were correct all along (verified
   against `repack_gptq_to_plugin`'s exact unpacking math in
   `tensorrt_edgellm/checkpoint/repacking.py`); only the metadata was undiscoverable.
4. **Export the LLM with `--int4-gemm-plugin-version 1`, not the default 2**, into
   `checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning` - the shim also reads the `llm/` directory this
   writes there, at runtime (`SHARED_CHECKPOINT_DIR`):

   ```
   external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/.venv/bin/tensorrt-edgellm-export checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/quantized \
     checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning --task reasoning --skip-visual --int4-gemm-plugin-version 1
   ```

   No `--quantization` flag needed or wanted here; the exporter auto-detects the pre-quantized
   checkpoint from `config.json` itself. V1 (the legacy AWQ-swizzled plugin) exports within the
   board's RAM. With the default V2 (cuteDSL fragment-layout) plugin, the export itself gets
   OOM-killed on an 8 GB Orin Nano partway through - 6.8 GB resident at the kill, on an idle
   board; run to completion on a larger host, it peaks at 8.96 GB. It isn't a build problem: a
   V2 ONNX builds fine on the Orin, and that's what `--host-quantize` ships - see
   "Host-accelerated quantization" above.
5. **Export the vision tower to ONNX too, from the same downloaded snapshot** - the raw
   checkpoint (`vision_encoder/` + the snapshot root's `config.json`), not the quantized one:
   no quantization, vision stays FP16. This is `do_export_onnx_visual`; step 7's `visual_build`
   turns its output into the vision engine:

   ```
   external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/.venv/bin/tensorrt-edgellm-export checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/raw \
     checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning --task reasoning --skip-llm
   ```

   A vision engine built against a *different* checkpoint's externalized/refit weights will not
   load (`missing tensor model.projector.linear_fc1.bias`) - always build both from the same
   source.
6. **Validate the provider's `chat_template.jinja` after export.** Version 0.11 renders
   the original template in C++ and no longer supports `processed_chat_template.json`.
   `do_validate_chat_template` requires the exported template to match the pinned
   checkpoint byte-for-byte and rejects stale template artifacts. Do not apply the old
   JSON `content_types` repair or copy a template from another model.

   ```bash
   cmp checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/raw/chat_template.jinja \
     checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning/llm/chat_template.jinja
   ```
7. **Build the engines** as `do_build_engine` does: the SDK build's own binaries, with
   `EDGELLM_PLUGIN_PATH` set and a temporary swapfile on. Without `EDGELLM_PLUGIN_PATH`, both
   binaries look for the plugin at the relative path `build/libNvInfer_edgellm_plugin.so` and
   fail to parse the ONNX; without the swap, `llm_build` is OOM-killed on an 8 GB Orin Nano
   while serializing the engine.

   ```
   mkdir -p data engines/reasoning
   sudo fallocate -l 4G data/build-swap.img && sudo chmod 600 data/build-swap.img
   sudo mkswap data/build-swap.img && sudo swapon data/build-swap.img
   export EDGELLM_PLUGIN_PATH=/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/build/libNvInfer_edgellm_plugin.so
   external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/build/examples/llm/llm_build \
     --onnxDir checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning/llm --engineDir engines/reasoning \
     --maxInputLen 1024 --maxKVCacheCapacity 1024 --maxKVPoolPages 8 --maxBatchSize 1
   external/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/build/examples/multimodal/visual_build \
     --onnxDir checkpoints/Cosmos3-Edge/onnx/reasoning/visual --engineDir engines/reasoning \
     --minImageTokens 4 --maxImageTokens 1024 --maxImageTokensPerImage 512
   sudo swapoff data/build-swap.img && sudo rm data/build-swap.img
   ```

   The visual engine lands under `engines/reasoning/visual/` automatically. These specific
   input/KV/batch capacities match RAM headroom measured on an 8 GB Orin Nano - raising them
   needs re-measuring, not just a flag change. The per-image token budget is fixed here too
   (`--maxImageTokensPerImage 512`); the shim ignores a per-request
   `max_image_tokens_per_image`. `/opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/engines/reasoning` is what
   `engine-link` should point at below - `shim/cosmos3_shim_v1.py` reads `llm.engine` +
   `config.json` from there.

### 2. Install this repo

(If you already made the checkout for step 1, start at the `cd`.)

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo && sudo chown $USER /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo
git clone https://github.com/nv-asotelo/live-vision-cosmos-demo /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo
cd /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo
ln -s /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/engines/reasoning engine-link   # the directory containing llm.engine + config.json
cp ui/config/engines.example.json engines.json # edit "path" to match the engine-link above
```

### 3. Set up text-to-speech

```
# the release tarball unpacks into piper/, putting the binary at piper/piper - where the UI unit looks
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases/download/v1.2.0/piper_arm64.tar.gz | tar -xz
cd piper
curl -fsSL -o en_US-ljspeech-medium.onnx \
  "https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/en/en_US/ljspeech/medium/en_US-ljspeech-medium.onnx"
curl -fsSL -o en_US-ljspeech-medium.onnx.json \
  "https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/en/en_US/ljspeech/medium/en_US-ljspeech-medium.onnx.json"
cd /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo   # back to the repo root for the steps below
```

`medium` quality, not `high`: measured directly on an Orin, `high`-tier voices roughly double
synthesis time for the same sentence, which fights this project's own "fastest latency" design
goal for a marginal quality gain speech-through-a-small-speaker doesn't showcase. See NOTICE.md
before substituting a different voice - several published Piper voices carry non-commercial-only
licenses inherited from their base voice, not obvious from the filename.

### 4. Set up the Reachy Mini bridge (optional - only for using Reachy Mini as a video source)

```
python3 -m venv reachy_env && reachy_env/bin/pip install -r reachy/requirements.txt
```

Installs cleanly from prebuilt aarch64 wheels on JetPack + Python 3.12, no compilation needed.
`requirements.txt`'s own header explains the pinned `aiortc==1.10.1`: it's the version verified
against the robot. It has aiortc's RTX-decoding bug too - 1.10.1 and 1.14.0 both do, so upgrading
doesn't fix it; the bridge avoids it by answering H.264 without RTX. Motor/app/TTS control
(`--reachy-daemon-url`) does not need this bridge - it talks to the robot's own REST API directly.

### 5. TLS certificate

```
mkdir tls && openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 365 \
  -keyout tls/key.pem -out tls/cert.pem -subj "/CN=live-vision-cosmos-demo"
```

### 6. Services config and systemd units

```
cat > services.json <<'EOF'
{}
EOF
```

(`services.json` covers services this process does not itself manage besides the registered
engines - leave it empty unless you add more.)

Edit the `User`/`Group` placeholders in each `systemd/*.service`. The robot's address doesn't go
in the units: put it in `reachy.env`, which the UI and bridge units read at start - and which
`scripts/set-reachy-ip.sh` rewrites if you later switch robots. No robot? Skip the file, delete
the `--reachy-daemon-url` and `--piper-*` lines from the UI unit, and don't install the bridge
unit. With a robot, the UI's `--reachy-daemon-url` imports `reachy/reachy.py`, which needs
`requests` in the system Python the UI runs on: `sudo apt install python3-requests` (apt, not
pip - Ubuntu's system Python is externally managed). Then:

```
echo "REACHY_MINI_IP=192.0.2.50" | sudo tee /opt/live-vision-cosmos-demo/reachy.env  # your robot
sudo cp systemd/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp systemd/dropins/99-live-vision-cosmos-demo-swap.conf /etc/sysctl.d/
sudo install -d /etc/systemd/system/live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service.d
sudo cp systemd/dropins/live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service.d-10-no-swap.conf \
  /etc/systemd/system/live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service.d/10-no-swap.conf
sudo sysctl --system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim live-vision-cosmos-demo-ui
sudo systemctl enable --now reachy-mjpeg-bridge   # only if you set up the bridge
```

Engine switching (`/api/engines/*`) starts and stops the shim via `sudo -n systemctl {start,stop}
live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service` (its `service` value in `engines.json`, which the rule
must match exactly) - grant that specific, narrow passwordless sudo rule to whichever user runs
the UI service, rather than broader sudo access:

```
echo 'YOUR_USERNAME ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl start live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service, /usr/bin/systemctl stop live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/live-vision-cosmos-demo
```

The automated setup also pins the clocks (`do_pin_clocks`): `sudo nvpmodel -m 2` (`MAXN_SUPER` on
the Orin Nano Super; mode IDs differ between Jetson modules, so check `nvpmodel -q` afterwards)
and a small boot-time `jetson-clocks.service`, since `jetson_clocks` doesn't survive a reboot.
Measured, that takes 36-60 ms off every request.

Open `https://<orin-ip>:8443/`.

**Before trusting this deployment, check the actual generated text, not just that the UI
loads and services report ready.** A broken engine has been observed to pass both of those
checks - health endpoints ready, structurally valid API responses with correct token counts
- while every actual generated response was complete garbage. Submit a real request
(through the UI, or `curl .../v1/chat/completions` on the shim's port directly) and confirm
the response is coherent text matching the prompt.

## Adding a second engine

`engines.json` is a registry, not a single path - add a second entry with its own `backend_port`,
`service`, and `path` (pointing at a second built engine directory) to get a live model-switch
button between them, with a real elapsed-time progress bar during the swap. Every registered
`protocol` must currently be `"cosmos"` (an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` + `/health/ready`
shim, same contract as `shim/cosmos3_shim_v1.py`) - `ui/scripts/engine_backends.py` validates the
registry strictly and will refuse anything else.

The second entry's `service` is a separate systemd unit you create - for example a copy of
`live-vision-cosmos-demo-shim.service` under a new name, with `Environment=ENGINE_DIR=...` and
`Environment=PORT=...` set to that engine directory and its `backend_port` (see
`shim/cosmos3_shim_v1.py` for the other environment variables it reads). Leave it disabled;
switching starts and stops it. For a copy of this shim, keep the entry's `model_id` at
`nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge`: a switch waits for the new service's `/v1/models` to list the entry's
`model_id`, and this shim always reports `nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge`. A switch runs
`sudo -n systemctl stop` on every other registered service and `sudo -n systemctl start` on the
selected one, so add `start` and `stop` rules for the new unit - spelled exactly as its
`service` value in `engines.json` - to `/etc/sudoers.d/live-vision-cosmos-demo`, then check the
file with `sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/live-vision-cosmos-demo`. Without them, the first
switch stops the shim, can't start the new service or restore the old one, and inference stays
down.

## Running the tests

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s ui/tests
node --test ui/tests/test_engine_switch.js
```

50 tests total. No device, network, GPU, or model required - a fake HTTP backend (Python) and a
fake DOM (JS) stand in for both.
